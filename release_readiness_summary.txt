CustomerCareGPT Release Readiness Summary
==========================================

Overall Score: 72/100 - NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

Top 3 Blockers:
1. CRITICAL: Missing dependencies (prometheus_client, pytest) preventing proper functionality
2. CRITICAL: Configuration issues (settings.ENVIRONMENT undefined, hardcoded values)
3. HIGH: Insufficient test coverage (only basic file processing tests present)

Go/No-Go Recommendation: NO-GO

Required Actions Before Staging:
- Fix missing dependencies in requirements.txt
- Resolve configuration issues in core/config.py
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Validate Docker stack functionality
- Configure proper environment variables

Estimated Time to Production Ready: 14-20 hours

The codebase demonstrates excellent architectural design and comprehensive feature implementation, but requires immediate attention to configuration issues and missing dependencies before production deployment.
